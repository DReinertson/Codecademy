$ cat rocks.txt

In geology, rock or stone is a naturally occurring solid aggregate of one or more minerals or
mineraloids. For example, the common rock granite is a combination of the quartz, feldspar and
 biotite minerals. The Earth's outer solid layer, the lithosphere, is made of rock.

Plants are one of five big groups (kingdoms) of living things. They are autotrophic eukaryotes
, which means they have complex cells, and make their own food. Usually they cannot move (not
counting growth).

Plants include familiar types such as trees, herbs, bushes, grasses, vines, ferns, mosses, and
 green algae. The scientific study of plants, known as botany, has identified about 350,000 ex
tant (living) species of plants. Fungi and non-green algae are not classified as plants.

A stream is a body of water[1] with a current, confined within a bed and stream banks. Dependi
ng on its location or certain characteristics, a stream may be referred to as a branch, brook,
 beck, burn, creek, crick, gill (occasionally ghyll), kill, lick, mill race, rill, river, syke
, bayou, rivulet, streamage, wash, run, or runnel.

$ cat trees.txt

In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches a
nd leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including
 only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a s
pecified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that h
ave independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to c
ompete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos a
re also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old.
