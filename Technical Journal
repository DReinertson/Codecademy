  - Basics :
      - Need to use className in JSX, not class = ''.
      - Self closing tags (img, br, etc) need to have '/' within tag
      - When rendering JS within JSX, you need to enclose JS within "{}"
      - Can use dot notation to refer to an object's properties and set them to variables
      - JSX event listeners (i.e. onClick) written with camel capitilization. Value should be a function
      - Don't inject if/then statements into JSX, won't work. 
      - Visited conditionals, ?: notation and &&
      - .map(x, i) to create unique keys for list.
