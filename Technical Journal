8/16/18 : React Authorization Form
  - Using React to check submit/form seems much easier that using HTML and JS separate. Being able to hide and show text via variables seems more effieicent that having to hide/show entire divs based upon criteria.

8/16/18 : React Components
  - Logic and conditionals must be inside the render() method but outside the return. 
  - Be sure to import respective libraries for React & ReactDOM. 
  - I can see how component classes and instances can really clean up code, by rendering variables instead of having a lot of HTML/JS noise. 
  - You can use this.instance to refer to an instance within the component class. 
  
8/12/18 : React cont.
  - Basics :
      - Need to use className in JSX, not class = ''.
      - Self closing tags (img, br, etc) need to have '/' within tag
      - When rendering JS within JSX, you need to enclose JS within "{}"
      - Can use dot notation to refer to an object's properties and set them to variables
      - JSX event listeners (i.e. onClick) written with camel capitilization. Value should be a function
      - Don't inject if/then statements into JSX, won't work. 
      - Visited conditionals, ?: notation and &&
      - .map(x, i) to create unique keys for list.
